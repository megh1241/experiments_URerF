Running scripts named "run_exp_XXX.R" will generate the Rdata files. To plot these files, run the corresponding script in plotting/scripts.
The plotting scripts are a little messy and might need slight changes (for eg the filepath of the .Rdata file)

Figure in paper: Instructions to run, plotting script

Figure 2: run_exp_vary_split_criteria.R calls vary_bicvstmt.R, ggplot_bic_rer.R

Figure 3:
    Top: run_exp_vary_min_parent.R, ggplot_minparent2.R 
    Bottom: run_exp_vary_mtry.R, ggplot_mtry.R

Figure 4: 
    Top: run_exp_10e4_dim_noise.R, hw_ggplot_fig4_logscale.R
    Bottom: run_exp_10_dim_noise.R hw_ggplot_fig4.R

    Instructions to run the run_exp_XXX.R in figure 4:
    Run it three times, each time uncommenting one of the source("xxx") lines (instructions given in the run_exp_XXX.R). One of the source files generates euc distance prec recall,
     the second generates flann pre recall and the third generates the remaining (URerF, adele RF, UMAP, isomap)

    run the hw_ggplot_fig4 scripts to generate the plots

Figure 5:
    Left: I ran Youngser's script to generate this plot. Follow this link (http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/MBstructure/demo/sec4.html) for more info/script
    Right: run_exp_drosophila.R, ggplot_dros.R
